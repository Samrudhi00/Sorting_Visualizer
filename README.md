Time and Space Complexitites:


Sure, here are the time and space complexities for the sorting algorithms implemented in your code:

Selection Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Insertion Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Merge Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Quick Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) (worst case), O(n log n) (average case)
Space Complexity: O(log n)

Heap Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Counting Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n + k), where k is the range of input
Space Complexity: O(k)

Even Odd Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) (worst case)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Radix Sort:
Time Complexity: O(d * (n + k)), where d is the number of digits, and k is the radix (base) of the numbers
Space Complexity: O(n + k)

These complexities are based on the typical implementations of the algorithms. 
Keep in mind that the actual performance may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the input data.
